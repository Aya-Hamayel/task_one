        Hello! I’m Aya Hamayel.

        I’m 20 years old and currently studying Computer Engineering at Birzeit University.<br>
         My passion lies in
        technology and innovation, where I enjoy exploring the latest trends in software development
         and hardware<br>
        design. I'm particularly interested in areas such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and UI/UX design.
<br>
        Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, coding, and volunteering. I’m always eager to learn,<br>
         grow, and contribute
        to the field of computer engineering.
